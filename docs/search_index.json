Primary interest is centered on the location (median) of the population. Assumptions: Let \\(Z_i = Y_i - X_i, i =1,...,n\\) The differences \\(Z_i,...Z_n\\) are mutually independent. \\(X_i\\) and \\(Y_i\\) can be dependent Each \\(Z_i\\) comes from a continuous population (not necessarily the same one) and has a common median \\(\\theta\\) \\(P(Z_i \\le \\theta) = P(Z_i &gt; \\theta) = 1/2\\) \\(P(Z_i - \\theta \\le 0) = P(Z_i -0 &gt; 0) = 1/2\\) \\(\\theta\\) is the treatment effect Under \\(H_0\\): * Each of the distributions for the differences has median 0, corresponding to no shift in location due to the treatment. * Sign statistic is the number of positive \\(Z_i\\)’s… * \\(T = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}l_{{z_{i}&gt;0}}\\) * random variable \\(l_{{z_{i}&gt;0}}\\) follows a Bernoulli distribution with \\(p = \\frac{1}{2}\\) * T follows a binomial(n,1/2) distribution 4.2 Large sample tst 4.3 Wilcoxon signed rank test 4.4 Large sample approximation "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
